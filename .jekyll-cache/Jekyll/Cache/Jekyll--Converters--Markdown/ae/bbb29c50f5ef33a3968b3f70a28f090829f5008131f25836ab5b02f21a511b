I"Á<p>This site exists to document the nuggets I pick up on my way to becoming a better programmer, hopefully saving other people some time along the way. My main interests are in Swift and the Apple frameworks, Haskell, and functional programming in general.</p>

<p>Me: Canadian living in NYC, hip hop head, and bicycle evangelist. Like programming? You should apply to the <a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center</a> right this minute.</p>
