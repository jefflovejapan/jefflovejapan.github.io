<p>In the world of economics, <em><a href="http://economicsmicro.blogspot.com/2008/11/law-of-diminishing-marginal-utility.html">marginal utility</a></em> is the amount of benefit provided by some small change â€” another slice of pizza, an extra minute of leisure time, or that one last beer. With <em>Marginal Futility,</em> my goal is to log the little things I figure out as I try to get better at programming, hopefully giving others a leg up along the way.</p>

<p>The blog is inspired by awesome people like <a href="http://jvns.ca">Julia Evans</a>, <a href="http://natashatherobot.com">Natasha the Robot</a>, and <a href="http://ashfurrow.com">Ash Furrow</a>, who advocate writing at all costs. Also, a massive thank you to the <a href="http://recurse.com">Recurse Center</a>, the greatest place on earth.</p>
