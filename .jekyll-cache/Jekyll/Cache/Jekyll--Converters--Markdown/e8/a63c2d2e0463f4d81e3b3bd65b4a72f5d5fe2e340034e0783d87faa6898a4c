I"/<p>Lately I’ve been feeling like I’m not doing enough learning outside work hours, so when my coworkers shared their personal goals for 2020, I thought, “This is it – this is the year I read a technical book a month.” Since I work with AVFoundation every day at <a href="https://1se.co">1 Second Everyday</a>, I figured what better way to start than with a book-length treatment of tktk, <a href="http://www.learningavfoundation.com"><em>Bob McCune’s Learning AV Foundation: A Hands-on Guide to Mastering the AV Foundation Framework</em></a>.</p>
