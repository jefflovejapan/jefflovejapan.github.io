I"√<p>Core Data has always been a weak area for me, having never worked with it professionally<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. At the same time, I feel like I could use a refresher on Realm to be able to articulate the differences between them better. So instead of following the plan and reading one book a month, I read three over the course of February and March:</p>

<h2 id="how-were-the-books">How were the books?</h2>

<p>I learned a lot from all three books, but I wish I‚Äôd read the Ray Wenderlich book on Core Data before reading Objc.io‚Äôs. Broadly, I think the Wenderlich book provides a much better introduction and ramp up for people who have never worked with Core Data before, while the Objc.io book provides a lot of handy functions and best practices for working with Core Data. I‚Äôm a fan of Florian‚Äôs coding style from the other books and videos and found plenty to like here.</p>

<p>That said, unlike the Wenderlich book, the Objc.io is really not project-based. It‚Äôs more difficult to follow along with the sample code, and sometimes the explanations are worded in a way that makes me wonder whether it‚Äôs a mistake or if I‚Äôm misunderstanding something they‚Äôd said earlier.</p>

<p>The Realm book is also from the team at Ray Wenderlich and feels very comparable to their Core Data book in terms of scope, building up the sample projects, etc. As someone who‚Äôs done a decent amount of work with Realm I still learned some useful things, and wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend it to someone wanting to jump into Realm for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="so-should-i-use-core-data-or-realm">So should I use Core Data or Realm?</h2>

<p>This is obviously going to depend a lot on your use case, but I‚Äôd sum up the difference between how I think about the two like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Core Data is like a framework for building object graph management solutions. You can control every aspect of how data moves to and from disk and how your multithreaded code behaves, and with child contexts you can treat whole Core Data ‚Äúenvironments‚Äù as virtual scratch pads.</li>
  <li>Realm has batteries included. There‚Äôs generally one right way to do something. And with Realm Sync Server you can get data syncinc between multiple users with very little code.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would reach for Core Data if I was trying to minimize my dependency on third-party libraries, or if I had a need to work with large graphs of data and wanted to optimize reads and writes very tightly. To give you a sense of what I mean, executing a fetch request always involves a round-trip to disk, so you want to limit how frequently you‚Äôre performing them. And data that‚Äôs included in a fetch result typically contains faults ‚Äì references to other managed objects that haven‚Äôt been populated yet. You determine when you want to pay for the faults to be filled. Changes that you make in the context have to be explicitly saved to the store. You can use subentities if you want multiple types of entities to be stored together, but these don‚Äôt behave like subclasses. The list goes on.</p>

<p>I would go for Realm if I was just trying to get something up and running. Specifying a schema is as simple as inheriting from <code class="highlighter-rouge">Realm.Object</code> and async code is easy to understand. For example, any time you mutate a managed Realm object it needs to be in a write transaction. In general, it seems like it‚Äôs less powerful and gives you less control, but there are fewer opportunities to shoot yourself in the foot.</p>

<h3 id="core-data">Core Data</h3>

<ul>
  <li>You can‚Äôt pass Core Data contexts or objects across threads. For access to an object on a separate thread you‚Äôll want its <code class="highlighter-rouge">NSManagedObject.objectID</code>, which is threadsafe.</li>
  <li>Core Data‚Äôs persistent store coordinator will keep all contexts backed by the same persistent container up to date. This means that you can save changes to your object on context 1 and context 2 will get notified about it, assuming you have notifications set up.</li>
  <li>A lot of the complaints I‚Äôve heard from people who work with Core Data revolve around reasoning about child contexts. The way they‚Äôre presented in the Wenderlich book seems to be entirely as in-memory scratchpads whose changes you can either commit or throw away. Calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">save()</code> on a child context only saves those changes to the parent context, not to the store.</li>
  <li>The Objc.io book comes out pretty strongly against nested contexts, with the exception of the single parent-child case.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="realm">Realm</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Realm can be made very performant when you need to do a ton of writes, but it requires some screwing around to get a run loop installed on a background thread.</li>
  <li>Realm allows reads and writes from any thread, publishing notifications on the thread they were created from. The realm and its objects can‚Äôt be passed across threads.</li>
  <li>Calling <code class="highlighter-rouge">Realm(configuration:)</code> to initialize a new realm is usually a lightweight operation because the framework will return an existing instance for this thread if one‚Äôs available. In general, you shouldn‚Äôt hold onto realm instances and should hold onto the configuration and initialize on the fly instead. (There‚Äôs an exception when you‚Äôre writing on a single dedicated <em>thread.)</em></li>
  <li>By default, adding an object to a realm where another object of the same type shares its primary key will error instead of applying the changes.</li>
  <li>It‚Äôs very simple to set up Realm Cloud, at least with their PaaS (not sure about self hosting.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="differences-and-similarities">Differences and similarities</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Unlike Core Data, Realm doesn‚Äôt allow for cascading deletes out of the box, but the Wenderlich book shows you how to build a simple implementation.</li>
  <li>Migrations in Core Data and Realm seem more or less similar. The same kinds of automatic migrations can be performed for you, and you perform more complex migrations in a similar way. Core Data provides a graphical editor for its data models, giving you a way to map old to new by specifying stuff in a GUI (‚Äúcustom mapping model‚Äù) as a middle ground between a fully automatic migration and a fully custom one.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion?</h2>

<p>The abstractions in Core Data are a lot cooler than I thought they were, and it seems like a lot of people‚Äôs complaints about it are probably more related to complex configurations than poor design decisions by the framework‚Äôs authors. That said, I like that Realm makes easy things easy, and for a lot of projects, the sacrifice in performance and predictability will be justified by the reduced engineering effort to keep things working.</p>

      <p>Except for that time that I used it (terribly) in a take-home project for a job application. I got the job, which reinforces my idea that people think Core Data is an important thing to know, whether or not they actually want to use it in their projects.¬†<a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
