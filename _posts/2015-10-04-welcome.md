### What is Marginal Futility?

In the world of economics, *[marginal utility](http://economicsmicro.blogspot.com/2008/11/law-of-diminishing-marginal-utility.html)* is the amount of benefit provided by some small change in the status quo -- another slice of pizza, an extra minute of leisure time, or that one last beer. With *Marginal Futility,* my goal is to log the little things I figure out, scattering breadcrumbs on my way to becoming a better programmer and hopefully giving others a leg up along the way.

The blog is inspired by awesome people like [Julia Evans](http://jvns.ca), [Natasha the Robot](http://natashatherobot.com), and [Ash Furrow](http://ashfurrow.com), who advocate writing at all costs. Also, a massive thank you to the [Recurse Center](http://recurse.com), the greatest place on earth, without which I would never be programming in the first place.
