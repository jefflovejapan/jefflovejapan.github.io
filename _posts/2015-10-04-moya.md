title: Getting Started with Moya
---

[Moya](http://github.com/moya/moya) is an awesome networking library, built on top of Alamofire, that applies the best of Swift's language and compiler features to your network requests. Its key insight is tying URL request-building logic to an enumerated type, both guaranteeing that you don't miss anything, and allowing you to cleanly factor code out of your main suite of public "call this endpoint" functions. On top of that, there are subspecs supporting both [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/Moya/Moya) and [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift), making it relatively easy to support [functional reactive programming](https://realm.io/news/altconf-ash-furrow-functional-reactive-swift/) in your project.

## What's in the Box?

### Target

At its heart, Moya revolves around a single protocol called `MoyaTarget`. This is the enumerated type alluded to earlier, and encompasses your base URL and paths, supplied parameters, and HTTP methods. Since we're using the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public), let's call our implementation `TwitterTarget`.

~~~swift
public enum Target: MoyaTarget {
    case .HomeTimeline:
    case .NewPost(text: String):

    var baseURL: NSURL { return NSURL(string: "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/")! }

    var path: String { 
        switch self {
            case .HomeTimeline:
                return "statuses/user_timeline.json"
            case .NewPost:
                return "statuses/update.json"
        } 
    }

    var method: Moya.Method {
        switch self {
            case .HomeTimeline:
                return .GET
            case .NewPost:
                return .POST
        }
    }

    var parameters: [String: AnyObject] {
        switch self {
            case .HomeTimeline:
                return [:]
            case .NewPost(let text):
                return ["status": text]
        }
    }

    var sampleData: NSData { return NSData() }  // We just need to return something here to fully implement the protocol
}
~~~

So for each of the protocol methods we can switch on `self` (enums are awesome), using `let` bindings to pull out associated values where we need them. The only non-obvious method is `sampleData` --- it's related to testing, we'll come back to it later.

### Provider

In order to interact with our `Target` we'll need an instance of `MoyaProvider`; its `request` method is the gateway between our `TwitterTarget` and Twitter's servers. While we're at it, let's write a public function to wrap all of this stuff up.

~~~swift
    let provider = MoyaProvider<TwitterTarget>()

    public func getTimeline() -> (tweets: [Tweet]?, error: ErrorType?) {
        provider.request(.HomeTimeline) { [unowned self] (data: NSData?, statusCode: Int?, response: NSURLResponse?, error: ErrorType?) in
            guard self.requestSucceeded(statusCode) else {
                let error = // some error
                return (nil, error)
            }

            guard let data = data,
            json = try? NSJSONSerialization(data: data, options: NSJSONReadingOptions(),
            jsonArray = json as? [[String: AnyObject]] else {
                let error = // some error
                return (nil, error)
            }

            let tweets = jsonArray.flatMap { Tweet(json: $0) }
            return (tweets, nil)  
        }
    }
~~~

Using Moya we've factored everything but the bare essentials out of our public `getTimeline` function. The resulting code is much simpler, safer, and easier to reason about.

### Testing

One other awesome feature of Moya is that we can make a slight modification to our `TwitterTarget` in order to stub out typical Twitter API responses. First, let's implement that `sampleData` method for real. Let's use Twitter's [sample responses](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/home_timeline):

~~~swift
public enum Target: MoyaTarget {

    (...)

    var sampleData: NSData {
        switch self {
            case .HomeTimeline:
                let jsonStr = "[{\"coordinates\": null,\"truncated\": false,\"created_at\": \"Tue Aug 28 21:16:23 +0000 2012\",\"favorited\": false,\"id_str\": \"240558470661799936\",\"in_reply_to_user_id_str\": null,\"entities\": {\"urls\": [],\"hashtags\": [],\"user_mentions\": []},\"text\": ...]"
                if let data = jsonStr.dataUsingEncoding(NSUTF8StringEncoding) {
                    return data
                } else {
                    print("Couldn't serialize string")
                    return NSData()
                }

            case .NewPost:
                (...)
        }
    }
}
~~~

In order to get this into our tests, we're going to need an instance of `MoyaProvider` that we've configured for testing:

~~~swift
    let testProvider = MoyaProvider<TwitterTarget>(endpointClosure: MoyaProvider.DefaultEndpointMapping, endpointResolver: MoyaProvider.DefaultEndpointResolution, stubBehavior: MoyaProvider.ImmediateStubbingBehaviour)
~~~

This is almost the default configuration we get with a new `MoyaProvider`, save for the `stubBehavior` parameter, which we're using to indicate we want Moya to use the stubbed responses we specified above. Now we can write tests like this (using [Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) and [Nimble](https://github.com/Quick/Nimble), of course):

~~~swift
    describe("Getting the user's home timeline") {
        it("Should have some tweets") {
            getTimeline() { (tweets, error) in
                expect(tweets).toNot(beNil())
            }
        }
    }
~~~

It's easy to tweak the types of responses you get by using a different value for your `MoyaProvider`'s'  `endpointClosure` parameter.

## Where to go from Here?

### Headers

In order to add custom headers (say, for authentication), you're going to need to provide a value for the `endpointClosure` parameter of `MoyaProvider`.

~~~swift

let ourEndpointClosure = { (target: TwitterTarget) -> Endpoint in
        let url = target.baseURL.URLByAppendingPathComponent(target.path).absoluteString
        let endpoint = Endpoint(URL: url, sampleResponse: .Success(200, {target.sampleData}), method: target.method, parameters: target.parameters)
        let headers = headersForTarget(target)
        return endpoint.endpointByAddingHTTPHeaderFields(headers)
}

let provider = MoyaProvider<TwitterTarget>(endpointClosure: ourEndpointClosure)
~~~

### Functional Reactive Programming

If you'd rather use signals than completion closures you can still use everything we've done so far, only swapping the base `MoyaProvider` out with `RXMoyaProvider` (for RxSwift) or `ReactiveCocoaMoyaProvider` (for Reactive Cocoa). Now the provider's `request` method returns an `Observable` (or `Signal`) that you can map, filter, and bind to stuff.

Happy coding!
