This site exists to document the nuggets I pick up on my way to becoming a better programmer, hopefully saving other people some time along the way. My main interests are in Swift and the Apple frameworks, video editing, image processing, Haskell, and functional programming in general.

Me: Canadian traveling the world, snowboarder, hip hop head, and bicycle evangelist. Like programming? You should apply to the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) right this minute.
