This site exists to document the nuggets I pick up on my way to becoming a better programmer, hopefully saving other people some time along the way. My main interests are in Swift and the Apple frameworks, Haskell, and functional programming in general.

Me: Canadian traveling the world, hip hop head, and bicycle evangelist. Like programming? You should apply to the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) right this minute.
